Reflection:

For this Generator, I chose to generate faction names with the tones being harsh, elegant, whimsy, mystical, and futuristic. Some of the more effective ones were harsh and futuristic tones due to each name generated by each fitted the tones that they correspond to. While some tones that were more difficult to make and caused failures were elegant, mystical, and blend. Elegant and mystical had similar kinds of names so it was hard to decide which name goes to which tone and blend was hard due to being difficult trying to get different prefixes and names from the different tones and putting it together.
